# Functional programming -- resources

## Youtube
- [Functional programming design patterns by Scott Wlaschin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8I19uA-wGY) -- highly recommended, if you only want to spend an hour on the topic, watch this

## Coursera
 - [Functional Programming Principles in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1) -- a bit formal (as an university course should be), but explains the concepts, not just the syntax

## Pluralsight
- [Functional Programming: The Big Picture](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/functional-programming-big-picture)
- [Scala: The Big Picture](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/scala-big-picture) -- talks mostly about the syntax and constructs, the Coursera course above provides much bigger picture
- [Functional Programming with C#](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/functional-programming-csharp)
- [Applying Functional Principles in C#](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/csharp-applying-functional-principles)
